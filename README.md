# every-data-scientist-should-know :thinking: 
A collection of (mostly) technical things every data scientist should know :chart_with_upwards_trend: :chart_with_downwards_trend: 

:point_up: These are resources I can recommend to every data scientist regardless of their skill level or tech stack

This is a `s/programmer/data-scientist/g` of [every-programmer-should-know](https://github.com/mtdvio/every-programmer-should-know) by [@mtdvio](https://github.com/mtdvio). That meas two things: 1. I take no credit for the idea of creating this page, I just wanted one for data-science and 2. things that are *purely* related to software development will not be the focus of this page, though there may be limited duplication.

# What do *YOU* think every data scientist should know?

### (see [Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md))

As in the original, all of the following applies:

   Highly opinionated :bomb:. Not backed by science.  
   Comes in no particular order :recycle:

   U like it? :star: it and [share](https://twitter.com/mr_mig_by/status/900735231552098306) with a friendly data scientis!
   U don't like it? [Watch the doggo](https://twitter.com/RespectfulMemes/status/900147758845308930) :dog:

   *P.S. You [don't need to know](https://xkcd.com/1050/) all of that by heart to be a data scientist.  
   But knowing the stuff will help you become better! :muscle:*
     
   P.P.S. [Contributions](CONTRIBUTING.md) are welcome!*
